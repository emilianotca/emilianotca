### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Github profile. Here's a bunch of information about myself, so you can get to know me:

:books: I study Electrical Engineering at the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) and I'm specialized in Computer Science, but I also have a great passion for Microelectronics. I love to discuss circuits, algorithms and literature. My favorite book is Dom Casmurro, by the famous brazilian novelist Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis.

:movie_camera: I love to watch movies and have spent (will spend too) several hours of my life doing it. Great movies are like great paintings: when you see a good one, do you only look at it once?

:cat2: I'm a cat person, but I love animals in general. 

:round_pushpin: I'm brazilian (born and raised), more specifically _mineiro_ (which means that I'm from the state of Minas Gerais), but I also speak English and German. You can reach out to me in any of these languages. By the way, we speak Portuguese in Brazil, not Spanish. Yes. Surprise surprise.

:beers: If you want to be my friend, invite me to have a beer.

:computer: I have a great passion for the art of programming and for Computer Science in general. I love to talk about it, explain it and work with it.

:sound: from Rock and Roll to Classical Music, I'll listen to it. But mostly Classical.
